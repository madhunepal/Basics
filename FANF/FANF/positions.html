        Since its inception, our organization has commented on many aspects of management of the Apalachicola National Forest.  More recently, we have written our position through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process on the Telogia, Soldier Bay, Beasley Pond, Brickyard, and RCW Core Analysis Area projects.   Collectively, we spent hundreds of hours gathering information in the field, discussing our positions, and writing comments.  The Apalachicola Forest documents about these projects can be found at:  https://www.fs.usda.gov/projects/apalachicola/landmanagement/projects. <br />
